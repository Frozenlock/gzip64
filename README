# gzip64

Compress with Gzip and encode in base 64 for easy web transfer

## Usage

Add [org.clojars.frozenlock/gzip64 "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"] in your project dependencies.

(use 'gzip64.core)

(gz64 "asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf")

-> "H4sIAAAAAAAAAEssTklTSCSBAAC000TuMQAAAA=="

(gunz64 "H4sIAAAAAAAAAEssTklTSCSBAAC000TuMQAAAA==")

-> "asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf"

Of course, the advantage can't be seen in such a small string because
of the compression overhead.

Let's look at a slightly longer string:

(gz64 "asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf")

-> "H4sIAAAAAAAAAEssTklTSByBBACDkiiB+QAAAA=="
